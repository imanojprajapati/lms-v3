## Overview
Enhanced the "Edit User" dialog with a professional amber/yellow gradient background theme to provide a better visual experience and maintain consistency with other styled dialogs in the application.

## Changes Made

- **Description**: Added description with `text-amber-700` styling
- **Layout**: Used flex layout with gap for icon and text alignment

### 3. Form Input Styling
- **Labels**: All form labels styled with `text-amber-700 font-medium`

- **Update Button**: Prominent amber background with shadow:
  - `bg-amber-600 hover:bg-amber-700`
  - `shadow-lg` for depth
  - White text for contrast

## Design Philosophy
- **Amber Theme**: Represents editing, modification, and caution
- **Consistency**: Maintains the pattern established by other dialogs:
  - Delete Dialog: Red/orange theme (destructive action)
  - View User Dialog: Blue theme (informational)
  - Create User Dialog: Green theme (creative action)
  - Edit User Dialog: Amber theme (modification action)
- **Accessibility**: Maintains proper contrast ratios and focus indicators
- **User Experience**: Provides clear visual feedback for editing operations

## Technical Implementation
- Uses Tailwind CSS gradient utilities for smooth color transitions
- Employs consistent amber color palette throughout the dialog
- Maintains semantic color usage (amber for editing/modification)
- Preserves existing functionality while enhancing visual design

## Color Scheme Details
- **Primary**: Amber-50 to Yellow-50 gradient background
- **Accents**: Amber-200 borders and dividers
- **Text**: Amber-700/800 for labels and titles
- **Interactive**: Amber-600/700 for buttons and active states
- **Focus**: Amber-400 with 20% opacity ring

## Result
The Edit User dialog now features a beautiful amber gradient background that:
- Clearly indicates editing/modification context
- Provides visual consistency with other styled dialogs
- Creates an intuitive user experience during user editing
- Maintains professional appearance and accessibility standards
- Uses semantic colors that align with the editing action being performed

The implementation ensures the dialog stands out as an editing-focused interface while maintaining harmony with the overall application design system.
