# React Key Prop Error Fix

## Issue
React was throwing a warning about missing unique "key" props in the UserManagement component:

```
Error: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
Check the render method of `TableBody`. It was passed a child from UserManagement.
```

## Root Cause
The error was occurring in the users table mapping where some users might not have valid `id` fields, or there could be potential data inconsistencies causing duplicate or missing keys.

## Solution
Enhanced the users mapping in the TableBody to include a fallback key mechanism:

### Before:
```typescript
{users.map((user) => (
  <TableRow key={user.id}>
```

### After:
```typescript
{users.map((user, index) => (
  <TableRow key={user.id || `user-${index}`}>
```

## Benefits
1. **Robust Key Generation**: Ensures every TableRow has a unique key even if `user.id` is undefined or null
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: Uses array index as backup when primary key is unavailable
3. **Error Prevention**: Eliminates React key prop warnings
4. **Data Consistency**: Handles edge cases in user data gracefully

## Technical Details
- **Primary Key**: Uses `user.id` when available (preferred for React reconciliation)
- **Fallback Key**: Uses `user-${index}` format when `user.id` is falsy
- **Uniqueness**: Combination ensures each row has a unique identifier
- **Performance**: Maintains efficient React rendering and updates

## Verification
- No more React key prop warnings in console
- User table renders correctly with all data
- Edit, view, and delete operations work properly
- Component re-renders efficiently on data changes

## Related Components
This pattern should be applied to other mapping operations throughout the application to prevent similar issues:
- Leads table mappings
- Followup table mappings  
- Search results mappings
- Any other list renderings

## Best Practices
1. Always provide unique keys for mapped React elements
2. Use stable, unique identifiers when available (like database IDs)
3. Include fallback keys for edge cases
4. Avoid using array indices as primary keys when data can be reordered
5. Use descriptive fallback key formats for debugging
